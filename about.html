<div class="ct">
I grew up in the San Fernando Valley during the 90's.
Kurt Cobain was a fading memory and music and culture
had a life that one doesn't find these days. 
The multiverse perpetuated by modern day technology and algorithms was at best the fantasy of some 
autocratic tech bussiness man child.

<div class="ct">
Despite being rather musically inclinded-listening to music all alone in private as a child
and starting up my first instrument in middle school-I never really considered myself
artistic before a couple of years ago.

This is in muted contrast to the fact that
I thought of myself as a right brained person, because I 
enjoyed reading books slightly more than the average peer.


It started off by workplace boredom (something which, given my
current lack of employment sounds great) that
I sought to fight off without using my phone.
 

I was working at a school helping to watch over troublesome teens.

One teacher had a particularly firm grasp on her little hoodlums. 
This left me to my own devices for large swathes of my time in her classroom and it wasn't before
long that I decied to grab a piece of scrap paper and just doodle away. 

I'd never really doodled as a young person. 
That isn't to say I never tried. 
It just never worked out and (along with my horrific handwriting) I reasoned I wasn't one of those
kids that can draw. 


Anyway, it went pretty bad but it was mildly amusing and so it became a habit that due to my
neurotic nature became a real HABIT. 
It wasn't long, perhaps a day or two before I figured i'd come 
in with a photo on my phone (the original thing I was trying to avoid) that I wanted to draw. 

The kids thought it looked close-ish and I gained points with them.

THose points were motivation and that quickly became a motivation
to improve my drawing...


It took a while but eventually I started to realize that I wasn't really in my usual state of mind,
as I drew.
